### Charts and Insights
Monthly sales chart presents the monthly sales trends for different product categories over three years (2018â€“2020). The visualization helps identify seasonal trends, peak sales months, and year-over-year performance. Businesses can use this data to optimize inventory planning and promotional strategies based on demand fluctuations.

Sales by category chart breaks down sales by product category and sub-category, while also highlighting the profitability of each. Understanding which sub-categories contribute the most revenue and profit helps businesses make informed decisions about pricing, product focus, and marketing investments.

Profit Map represents profit distribution across different states in the USA. Locations with high losses are marked in red, while profitable areas are green. Businesses can use this insight to assess regional performance, adjust sales strategies, and focus on improving profitability in underperforming locations.

### Key Points

Category Performance: Some sub-categories, like bookcases and binders, generate significant sales but may have varying profit margins.
